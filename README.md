Welcome Nosjazz,

[View the live project here.](https://data-3.herokuapp.com/home)

This website has been created in order to complete the 3rd milestone project of the code institute fullstack diploma. This is a prelaunch website with a landing page centralizing the information, a About page giving more information about the project, a reviews page to centralize all reviews written, a contact us page, and a login/logout function.  HTML, CSS, JS, Python and MongoDB as well as Flask and Jquery were used. 


## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the project, leave if review and have the option to contact the website owner directly.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be see a visually compellent design.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see reviews from other visitors.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find back the information I entered

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are blue and white to have a high contrast, low eyes strain application.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Poppins is a simple font that is appealing for this purpose.
        
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The images used were kept minimum to convey a simmple design, keeping one for the company logo and banner, as well as one image to present to team members.

*   ### Wireframes

    -   Home Page [Wireframe](https://github.com/Nosjazz/milestone_3/tree/master/static/images/wireframes). Due to time contraints, the project was adaptated to conserve the minimum features, removing the Interested and Pledged below the banner, while also removing the banners for the contact Us, login and review Add page.
